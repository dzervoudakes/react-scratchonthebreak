# Scratch On The Break
> Rebuilt my buddy's [Scratch On The Break](https://scratchonthebreak.com/) site with React.

## Instructions

##### Install Dependencies
Note: I recommend `node` >= v9.0.0 and `npm` >= v5.6.0 to run the application.

```
npm install
```

##### Start Local Server
```
npm start
```

##### Run Linting
```
npm run lint
```

##### Run Linting with Fix
```
npm run lint:fix
```

##### Build for Production
```
npm run build
```

##### Server Environments
The same Express server runs development and production builds.

> To run the server locally with webpack dev middleware, set `NODE_ENV=development`

> To run the production server with static build assets from 'dist', set `NODE_ENV=production`
